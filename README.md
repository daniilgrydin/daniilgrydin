## Hello there 👋

My name is Daniil (**Daniel**) Grydin. I do all sorts of things, from web and application development to videogames and all things math.

## Education 🎓

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of **Computer Science and Mathematics** degree in Canada. I love learning new things, especially when those thing bring me closer to applying group theory to the multiverse.

## Projects 🛠️

My current big project is **my website [grydin.com](https://grydin.com)**, as I am trying to populate it with content, both new and old!

While developing it I have developed a few tools to help me, the first one is [Veles](https://github.com/daniilgrydin/veles), a python-based static website generator. But soon I encountered that I need a very specific way to log progress and compilation, which is how [Bojan](https://github.com/daniilgrydin/bojan) was created.

## Hobbies 🖼️

Among things I enjoy I would list (not in any order):
1. Designing **user interfaces**
2. Writing **documentations**
3. Engineering **user experience**
4. Playing **videogames**
5. Studying **languages and cultures**
6. Spending time with my **friends and family**
